### Book Inventory App


## Demo

![Frontend](D:\Tushar\Bhanu\Book_inv_app\dist\frontend.exe)

## Overview

It is a real-world program called the Book Inventory App which allows you to store book information in the database. User can query using this app like search a book, add/insert a book entry, view the entry of all the books in the database, etc.


## Motivation

We all have spent time in the library looking at the huge collection of books. I always thought that whenever we ask the librarian about any particular book, he/she tells about it in few seconds. It was the time I came across the fact that there is a place called database which can store a lot of information and one can retrieve that information anytime he wants. This was my motivation behind building this project. 

## Technical Aspect

The app is divided into two parts:
1.	Graphical User Interface (GUI)
2.	Backend coding
The steps involved in making this app are as follows:
1.	Designing the user interface – It includes forming the layout of the window that we will be visible to the viewer/user.
2.	Coding the Frontend Interface – It involves placing all the labels, entry box and buttons keeping the design of the interface in mind.
3.	Coding the Backend – It is done using the cursor object and execute command of Sqlite3 along with some functions.
4.	Connecting the Frontend and Backend by adding command to the widgets using Backend functions.
5.	Creating .exe executable file from Python script using pyinstaller.
